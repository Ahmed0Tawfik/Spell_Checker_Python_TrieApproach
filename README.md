# Spell_Checker_Python_TrieApproach

### Dictionary should be imported to thee words.txt file

### TrieNode class to make The structure of the Nodes 
### Trie class to make the whole structure of the trie with 
- insert word
- search word
- Suggest word or complete the word if the word is not completed

### Using Pickle we can serialize the trie object with the whole data in the object so we dont have to load all the words from the words.txt file
